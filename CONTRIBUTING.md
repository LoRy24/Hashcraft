# How to contribute

If you want to contribute to this project, you just have to follow some rules and then you can send a pull request after you have cloned and edited the 
code.

## Code style
The code design should be very clean and similar to the first commits made by me (You can see the Bootstrap.java class for example). Remember that
everything you write should be documented or commented. If you won't follow these tips you won't be able to collaborate to the repository.

**Example of code**
```java
/**
 * The "Main" class is the entry of our program.
 * @author LoRy24
 */
public class Main {

  /**
   * The main function. This is the start of our program
   */
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Print "Hello World!" in the console
    int x = -1;
    System.out.println(2 -x -1);
  }
}
```
