Hashcraft is a Minecraft Layer7 proxy designed to connect multiple spigot instances in only one network. 

## Description:

### Layer7 Minecraft Proxy
A Layer7 Minecraft reverse proxy is an application made to connect multiple spigot subserver in only one big network. To do that, a Minecraft proxy uses various types of techniques to make sure that everything will work.

### Reverse Proxy Definition
A reverse proxy (as you could know) is an application between the client and the actual server. His work is to accept connections from the Internet and redirect them to the backend server (in this case the spigot instance) by creating a new connection to it. After the two connections are correctly established, the proxy will reply the data received from the two sides, like magic ;)
